<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
For our final project at Grand Circus for the front end program, we have decided to really challenge ourselves and go above and beyond. 
This is a huge passion project for the three of us, since we're all share common interests in anime and video games. All artwork and music was created by the students. 
We implemented our own database, three different API's, Angular, Phaser, CSS, HTML, Typescript, Javascript, SCSS, JSON, Jquery and SQL. 
The project is an 2D platform game that is based off the three developers. Amber, Aaron and Garrett. 
Please review our app, and contact us either from our Linkedin down below. Or you can submit a message on the "About Us" page in our app.
